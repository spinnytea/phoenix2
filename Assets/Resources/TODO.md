# To Do List

1. Step one, what is the player going to do
    * we going to swing a sword
    * try keys:
        * L1 slash up, L2 slash down, L1+L2 stab (left side)
        * same for R1/R2 (right side)
        * left stick move
        * right stick adjust attack/defense
        * that leaves both D-Pads free
    * make the keys and animations feel good to control
    * try animations for different weapon types (I have a catalog somewhere)
1. once things are moving, make some sword effects. [Unity 2018 - Game VFX - Weapon Trails / Slash Tutorial

1. Update Unstable animation
    * right now, it just perterbs the angles
    * I really want it to keep the feet in the same place, but the hips sway around
    * like, i need inverse kinematics or something
